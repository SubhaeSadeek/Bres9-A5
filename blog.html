							The situation in Noakhalki is imporoving since yesterday. Water is
							receding in fe w areas but all area are still under water in
							Noakhali. We are managing 40 more boats to include in our rescue
							operation. Water is not incresing in most of the area and current
							is not too strong like last week. It seems, rescue work are now
							less risky and it is an opprtunity to speed up rescue operation.
							Children and elderly are specially in denger and it is estimated
							that we only rescued merely 40% of the flood victim. Begumganj and
							Maijdee upazila are most vulnerable of all.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							We are forming a coalition with several prominent volunteer
							organization of Noakhali. We want to speed up rescue operation and
							in perrarale we are engaging half of our resources to post flood
							rehabilitation programme. The major rehabilitation programme we
							are planning is to ensure waterborne diseases are on check,
							tubewell and sanitary toilets are restored and direct help to
							rebuild house that are destroyed. All the donations we get are
							promised to spend on most essential items and in most effective
							manners. We croud-source many activities that require physical
							labor. People are volunteering in neighboring disticts we made
							temporary working stations.
